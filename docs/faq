<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<ol>
	<li><b>How do I contact the webmaster?</b><br/>
		Best is to <a href="http://twitter.com/3dporch">follow me on twitter.</a>
	<li><b>Where did some of the UI images come from?</b><br/>
		The red-cyan glasses are from <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:3d_glasses_red_cyan.svg">Daniel Schwen</a>. The hearts are from <a href="http://www.fatcow.com/">FatCow Web Hosting</a>.
	<li><b><a name="cameras"></a>What cameras are supported?</b><br/>
		I've tested this on the Nintendo 3DS, Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W3 and W1, Sony DSC-TX9, and the Panasonic Lumix GH2 so far. But it probably works with any .MPO and .JPS file created by any 3D camera.
	<li><b>Anybody else you want to credit?</b><br/>
		Thanks to Eric Pinzur for helping me figure out how to automatically align images.
